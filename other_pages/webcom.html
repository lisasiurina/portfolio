<p><strong>Web Communications </strong> is a complete Digital Marketing Agency, "factory of ideas" that offers digital solutions for small, medium and large businesses. </p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>I am redesigning a website of a digital agency. I need to figure out what specific challenges users are facing while navigating a website, and how I can help fill those gaps and create an intuitive user interface.</p>

<ul>
<li>UX Research</li>
<li>User Flows</li>
<li>Sketches</li>
<li>UI Design & Interactive Prototyping</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Project Duration:&nbsp;</strong>7 - 15 January 2022.</p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this project, I followed Double Diamond UX process, that focuses on users and their needs. Here are the key steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Discover the problem:</strong> Gathering information about potential issues users are facing.Â </strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Define the problem:</strong> Focusing on the main issue your product aims to solve.</span></li>

</ol>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">1. Discover the problem</h2>
<h3>1.1 Research</h3>

<p><br></p>

                        <p>In order to gather observations during the user research I used an affinity diagram to organizes data into groups with common themes.</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the theme that: </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #3366ff;">some users do not feel at ease navigating through offered services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an insight is: </span><span style="color: #339966;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">users need a list of offered services to be structured and better divided into groups and subgroups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>

  <title>User-Centric Design and Simplicity</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>User-Centric Design</h1>
  <p>Placing the user at the center of the design process is crucial. By conducting thorough research, such as usability studies, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior and pain points. Understanding the needs and preferences of the target audience allows us to make informed design decisions that prioritize user satisfaction and engagement.</p>

  <h1>Simplicity and Ease of Use</h1>
  <p>Users value simplicity and ease of use. Overwhelming a website with excessive text or complex design elements can hinder users' ability to navigate and comprehend the content. It is important to present information in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for users to find what they need and accomplish their goals. Simplifying the user interface and reducing cognitive load greatly enhances the overall user experience.</p>
